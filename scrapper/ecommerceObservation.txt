Problem 1:

There wont be much intersection between products like between jackets and shoes, its because jackets don't have official
name like mobile phones, and amazon have named its jackets in different way with some hash, and name-name similarity wont
work in that case.

Solution 1: (No merge comparison and just render them and let user see the difference)

So android screen would be like this
# TODO if u dont get response within 1 min then kill the driver and start again or see if we can maintain a driver for each scrap
Fashion click --> categories (Shoes, jackets,jeans, shirts) and then each category clicked would go to next activity and
then two comparative recyclerview (sorted increasing order of size), on one side amazon and then another side flipkart
click on each item would open the webview in android app itself, add a button on the card itself to save it in cart 

Jackets - salomon (both), montrez jackets(female) and ben martin jacket (male)
Shoes -asian ,addidas, puma
shirts - young trendz t shirt (men),young trendz t shirt (women) 
Jeans -Urban Fashion jeans(Men), kotty jeans(Female), flying machine jeans(both)
